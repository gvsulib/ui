# README - GVSU Libraries UI Pattern Library

---

This tool was developed by Matthew Reidsma to make it easy to design new web projects at GVSU Libraries while maintaining a consistent look and feel to the user interface. GVSU uses a customized version of Bootstrap, so this pattern library serves as a supplement to the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/).

## DEMO

You can view a live version of this tool at https://gvsu.edu/library/ui.
